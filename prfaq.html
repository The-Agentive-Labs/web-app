        <p class="purpose">Work backwards from the customer by writing a future press release and FAQ before building the product.</p>
      </header>

          <h2>Learn</h2>
          
          <h3>What is PRFAQ?</h3>
          <p>PRFAQ is Amazon's signature product development approach: write a Press Release (PR) and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document as if the product already launched successfully. This "working backwards" method forces teams to think from the customer's perspective first, clarifying the value proposition before writing a single line of code.</p>

          <h3>Why It Works</h3>
          <p>Traditional product planning starts with features and capabilities. PRFAQ flips this: start with customer benefits and outcomes. By articulating what success looks like externally, teams avoid building features no one wants. If you can't write a compelling press release, you probably shouldn't build the product.</p>

          <h3>Framework & Placement</h3>
          <p>PRFAQ is used during <strong>Strategy & Planning</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>After:</strong> Research synthesis, personas, JTBD, and IRA framework</li>
            <li><strong>Before:</strong> PRD/MRD writing, engineering kickoff, and detailed feature specs</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It serves as a strategic alignment document that bridges research insights and execution.</p>

          <h3>Structure: Two Parts</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Press Release (PR):</strong> 1-page customer-facing announcement written in future tense. Includes headline, subhead, problem statement, solution description, customer quote, and call to action.</li>
            <li><strong>FAQ:</strong> Internal document answering tough questions about feasibility, costs, risks, and tradeoffs. This is where you pressure-test the idea.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Best Practices</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Write for Customers, Not Stakeholders:</strong> Use plain language. Avoid jargon, acronyms, or technical specs. A customer should understand the value immediately.</li>
            <li><strong>Lead with Benefits, Not Features:</strong> "Save 3 hours per week" beats "automated invoice reminders." Focus on outcomes.</li>
            <li><strong>Include a Real Customer Quote:</strong> Even if hypothetical, ground it in research. It should sound like something a user would actually say.</li>
            <li><strong>Be Specific:</strong> Vague PRs lead to vague products. Instead of "improved experience," say "onboarding takes 2 minutes instead of 15."</li>
            <li><strong>Pressure-Test in the FAQ:</strong> Don't shy away from hard questions: "Why would users switch from competitors?" "What's the biggest risk?" "What if adoption is low?"</li>
            <li><strong>Iterate:</strong> PRFAQs are living documents. Revise as you learn more. If you can't answer FAQ questions confidently, you need more research.</li>
          </ul>

<br>
<strong>[Customer Quote]</strong><br>
"[A quote from a real or hypothetical customer expressing excitement and describing the value they receive.]" — [Name, Role]<br>

            <code><strong>Customer FAQs</strong><br>
Q: Who is this for?<br>
A: [Target audience and use cases]<br>

          <h3>Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Review Research Insights:</strong> Before writing, ensure you understand the customer problem deeply. Reference personas, JTBD, and research findings.</li>
            <li><strong>Draft the Press Release:</strong> Write as if the product launched successfully 6-12 months from now. Use customer language, not internal jargon.</li>
            <li><strong>Get Feedback:</strong> Share the PR with team members who haven't been involved. Can they understand the value in 30 seconds? If not, revise.</li>
            <li><strong>Write the FAQ:</strong> Brainstorm every tough question stakeholders might ask. Answer honestly, even if the answer is "we don't know yet—here's how we'll find out."</li>
            <li><strong>Stress-Test:</strong> Play devil's advocate. What could go wrong? Why might customers NOT adopt this? Add these to the FAQ.</li>
            <li><strong>Iterate Based on Feedback:</strong> PRFAQs evolve as you learn. Update the document as assumptions are validated or invalidated.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Example: Freelance Invoice App</h3>
          <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Headline:</strong> InvoiceFlow Launches to Help Freelancers Get Paid Faster Without the Hassle</p>
            
            <p><strong>Subhead:</strong> New app automates invoice tracking, payment reminders, and reconciliation—saving freelancers hours per week and reducing late payment anxiety.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Freelancers waste 2-3 hours per week manually tracking invoices across email, spreadsheets, and bank accounts. When clients pay late—which happens 40% of the time—freelancers face cash flow stress and awkward follow-up conversations.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> InvoiceFlow is a simple, mobile-friendly tool that syncs with payment platforms (Stripe, PayPal), automatically tracks invoice status, and sends smart reminders to clients when payments are overdue. Freelancers get real-time visibility into cash flow without switching between tools.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Customer Quote:</strong> "I used to spend hours chasing invoices. Now InvoiceFlow does it for me, and I get paid faster without feeling like I'm nagging my clients." — Fran Martinez, Freelance Designer</p>
            
            <p><strong>Company Quote:</strong> "We built InvoiceFlow for the 59 million freelancers who deserve to focus on their craft, not on admin work. Getting paid shouldn't be painful." — Sarah Chen, Founder</p>
            
            <p><strong>Availability:</strong> InvoiceFlow is available now on web and iOS. Sign up for a free 30-day trial at invoiceflow.com.</p>

        </div>

        <h3>Key Considerations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>AI as Draft Assistant:</strong> Use AI to generate initial PR drafts or headline variations, but always rewrite in your own voice. Generic AI language lacks authenticity.</li>
          <li><strong>Customer Quote Authenticity:</strong> AI can suggest quote structures, but ground them in real research. Use actual user language from interviews.</li>
          <li><strong>FAQ Depth:</strong> AI can propose common questions, but humans must add the hard, company-specific questions that require strategic thinking.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>"AI in the Loop" Model</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Outline Generation:</strong> AI proposes a PRFAQ structure and headline options based on product description. Humans select the most compelling angle and refine.</li>
          <li><strong>Language Polishing:</strong> Humans write the first draft. AI suggests edits for clarity, conciseness, and customer-friendliness. Humans approve changes that maintain authentic voice.</li>
          <li><strong>FAQ Brainstorming:</strong> AI generates a list of potential FAQ questions (customer and internal). Humans prioritize the toughest questions and write honest, strategic answers.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Watch-Outs</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Don't let AI write the entire PRFAQ. It will produce generic, buzzword-filled content that lacks strategic depth and customer empathy.</li>
          <li>Avoid over-polishing. PRFAQs should be clear but not marketing fluff. If it sounds like corporate jargon, rewrite in plain language.</li>
          <li>Be cautious of AI generating overly optimistic PRs. Humans must reality-check feasibility and risks in the FAQ section.</li>
        </ul>
