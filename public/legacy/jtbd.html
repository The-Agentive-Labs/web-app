          <h3>What is Jobs to Be Done?</h3>
          <p>Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) is a framework that shifts focus from <em>who users are</em> to <em>what they're trying to accomplish</em>. The core idea: people "hire" products to do a job. Understanding the job—not the demographics—reveals why users choose your product over alternatives.</p>

          <p><strong>Example:</strong> A milkshake isn't hired for its flavor, but for the job of "keeping me full during my commute." This lens helps teams innovate beyond surface-level features.</p>

          <h3>Framework & Placement</h3>
          <p>JTBD is used during <strong>Strategy & Planning</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>After:</strong> User interviews, personas, and journey mapping</li>
            <li><strong>Before:</strong> Feature prioritization, roadmap planning, and solution design</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It bridges user research and product strategy by translating behaviors into actionable product requirements.</p>

          <h3>Core Concepts</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Functional Job:</strong> The core task (e.g., "send money to a friend quickly")</li>
            <li><strong>Emotional Job:</strong> How users want to feel (e.g., "feel confident I'm managing finances responsibly")</li>
            <li><strong>Social Job:</strong> How users want to be perceived (e.g., "appear generous to friends")</li>
            <li><strong>Circumstances:</strong> The context that triggers the job (e.g., "splitting a dinner bill")</li>
            <li><strong>Success Criteria:</strong> What "done" looks like (e.g., "payment received instantly, no awkward follow-up")</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Best Practices</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Start with "When... I want to...":</strong> Frame jobs as situational needs, not product features.</li>
            <li><strong>Focus on Progress, Not Tasks:</strong> Users don't want a drill; they want a hole in the wall. What progress are they trying to make?</li>
            <li><strong>Include Emotional and Social Dimensions:</strong> Functional jobs alone miss why users care. Dig into feelings and identity.</li>
            <li><strong>Map Competing Solutions:</strong> What do users hire today? (Competitors, workarounds, DIY hacks?) This reveals unmet needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Validate with Real Stories:</strong> Ask users to describe a recent time they "hired" a solution. Stories reveal true jobs, not hypothetical ones.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Template: JTBD Statement</h3>
          <div class="code-block">
            <code>When [SITUATION],<br>
I want to [MOTIVATION/GOAL],<br>
So I can [EXPECTED OUTCOME].<br>
<br>
<strong>Functional Job:</strong> [Core task to accomplish]<br>
<strong>Emotional Job:</strong> [Desired feeling/state]<br>
<strong>Social Job:</strong> [Desired perception by others]</code>
          </div>

          <h3>Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Identify the Situation:</strong> What triggers the need? Be specific about context (time, place, circumstances).</li>
            <li><strong>Define the Motivation:</strong> What is the user trying to achieve? Focus on the goal, not the product.</li>
            <li><strong>Articulate the Outcome:</strong> What does success look like? What changes when the job is done?</li>
            <li><strong>Layer in Emotional/Social Jobs:</strong> What feelings or social signals matter? How does this job relate to the user's identity?</li>
            <li><strong>Map Current Solutions:</strong> What do users hire today? (Your product, competitors, workarounds?) Why do they switch or stick?</li>
            <li><strong>Identify Underserved Jobs:</strong> Where are existing solutions failing? What progress do users struggle to make?</li>
            <li><strong>Validate with User Stories:</strong> Interview 5-10 users. Ask them to recount a specific time they faced this situation. Do their stories confirm the job?</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Example: Freelance Invoice App</h3>
          <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>JTBD Statement:</strong></p>
            <p>When <strong>I complete a project for a client</strong>,<br>
I want to <strong>get paid quickly and without awkward follow-up</strong>,<br>
So I can <strong>maintain cash flow and focus on my next project</strong>.</p>

            <p><strong>Functional Job:</strong> Create and send professional invoices; track payment status; automate reminders.</p>
            <p><strong>Emotional Job:</strong> Feel confident and in control of finances; reduce anxiety about late payments.</p>
            <p><strong>Social Job:</strong> Appear professional and organized to clients; avoid seeming desperate when chasing payments.</p>

            <p><strong>Current Solutions (Competing Products):</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Google Sheets + Gmail (free, but manual and error-prone)</li>
              <li>QuickBooks (powerful, but overkill for freelancers—too complex)</li>
              <li>PayPal Invoicing (integrated payments, but limited customization)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Underserved Need:</strong> Existing tools are either too manual (spreadsheets) or too complex (enterprise software). Freelancers need a middle ground: simple, automated, and payment-integrated.</p>

        <h3>Key Considerations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>AI for Job Extraction:</strong> Use AI to scan interview transcripts for language patterns ("I need to," "I wish I could," "I struggle with"). But humans must interpret context—AI misses sarcasm and nuance.</li>
          <li><strong>Emotional Layer:</strong> AI can flag emotional keywords ("anxious," "frustrated," "confident"), but humans must validate the emotional job through follow-up questions.</li>
          <li><strong>Job Prioritization:</strong> AI can quantify job frequency (how often it's mentioned), but humans must assess strategic importance (impact, differentiation, feasibility).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>"AI in the Loop" Model</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Job Hypothesis Generation:</strong> AI scans user feedback (interviews, support tickets, reviews) to propose potential jobs. Humans validate and refine based on strategic fit.</li>
          <li><strong>Competing Solution Mapping:</strong> AI analyzes competitor reviews and market data to identify what users currently "hire." Humans assess why users switch or churn.</li>
          <li><strong>JTBD Statement Drafting:</strong> AI generates initial "When... I want to..." statements. Humans refine for clarity, add emotional/social dimensions, and validate with users.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Watch-Outs</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Don't let AI define jobs based on product features. JTBD is about user progress, not "use our calendar tool." Keep it outcome-focused.</li>
          <li>Avoid over-reliance on AI sentiment analysis. Emotional jobs require deep listening—AI can't replace human empathy in interviews.</li>
          <li>Be cautious of "average job" bias. AI may surface the most common job, missing high-value niche jobs that differentiate your product.</li>
