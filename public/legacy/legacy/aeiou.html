          <h3>What is AEIOU?</h3>
          <p>AEIOU is an observational framework that helps researchers capture and organize field research findings. It stands for <strong>Activities, Environments, Interactions, Objects, and Users</strong>. By systematically documenting these five dimensions, researchers can build a rich, multi-layered understanding of user behavior in context.</p>

          <div class="aeiou-grid">
            <div class="aeiou-card">
              <h4>Activities</h4>
              <p>Goal-directed actions users perform</p>
            </div>
            <div class="aeiou-card">
              <h4>Environments</h4>
              <p>Physical or digital spaces where actions occur</p>
            </div>
            <div class="aeiou-card">
              <h4>Interactions</h4>
              <p>Exchanges between people, or people and objects</p>
            </div>
            <div class="aeiou-card">
              <h4>Objects</h4>
              <p>Tools, devices, or artifacts users engage with</p>
            </div>
            <div class="aeiou-card">
              <h4>Users</h4>
              <p>The people themselves—roles, behaviors, preferences</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Framework & Placement</h3>
          <p>Use AEIOU during:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ethnographic research and contextual inquiry</li>
            <li>Field observations (workplace studies, home visits, retail experiences)</li>
            <li>Early discovery when you need to understand "how things work today"</li>
          </ul>
          <p>AEIOU is especially useful when entering unfamiliar domains or when existing assumptions might be wrong.</p>

          <h3>Best Practices</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Observe First, Interpret Later:</strong> Capture raw observations without judgment. Analysis happens after fieldwork.</li>
            <li><strong>Be Specific:</strong> Instead of "user was frustrated," note "user sighed, closed laptop, walked away."</li>
            <li><strong>Use All Five Lenses:</strong> Don't skip categories. Even "Objects" can reveal critical insights (e.g., users relying on post-it notes instead of your app).</li>
            <li><strong>Pair with Photos/Sketches:</strong> Visual documentation strengthens AEIOU notes. Capture the environment, objects, and body language.</li>
            <li><strong>Debrief Immediately:</strong> Review notes within 24 hours while details are fresh. Fill in gaps and clarify ambiguities.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Template: AEIOU Observation Grid</h3>
          <div class="code-block">
            <code><strong>Activities:</strong><br>
[What are users trying to accomplish? What tasks are they performing?]<br>
<br>
<strong>Environments:</strong><br>
[Where does this happen? What's the context? Physical space, digital platform, time of day?]<br>
<br>
<strong>Interactions:</strong><br>
[How do users communicate with others? How do they interact with tools/systems?]<br>
<br>
<strong>Objects:</strong><br>
[What tools, devices, or materials are present? Which are used (or not used)?]<br>
<br>
<strong>Users:</strong><br>
[Who is involved? What are their roles, goals, pain points, workarounds?]</code>
          </div>

          <h3>Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Define Your Focus:</strong> What behavior or context are you studying? Be clear on the scope (e.g., "morning commute routine" vs. "all transportation habits").</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare Your Tools:</strong> Bring a notebook, camera, and AEIOU template. Brief your team on the framework.</li>
            <li><strong>Observe Holistically:</strong> Watch users in their natural environment. Take detailed notes across all five categories. Don't interrupt—observe first, ask questions later.</li>
            <li><strong>Document Everything:</strong> Capture what users say, do, and the tools/spaces they use. Note discrepancies (e.g., user says "it's easy" but struggles for 5 minutes).</li>
            <li><strong>Debrief as a Team:</strong> After fieldwork, review notes together. Identify patterns, surprises, and gaps that need follow-up.</li>
            <li><strong>Synthesize Insights:</strong> Use affinity mapping or thematic analysis to turn observations into actionable insights.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Example: Coffee Shop Work Session</h3>
          <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Activities:</strong> User opens laptop, connects to WiFi, responds to emails, joins video call. Pauses to order coffee. Returns to laptop, works on design mockups in Figma.</p>
            <p><strong>Environments:</strong> Corner table near outlet. Moderate noise (music, chatter). Natural light from window. Other remote workers nearby. Barista occasionally asks if user needs refills.</p>
            <p><strong>Interactions:</strong> User waves to barista to order. During video call, user mutes frequently due to background noise. No interaction with other patrons.</p>
            <p><strong>Objects:</strong> MacBook Pro, AirPods, external mouse, notebook, phone (face-down on table), reusable water bottle, coffee cup.</p>
            <p><strong>Users:</strong> Freelance designer, mid-30s. Prefers working outside home office for "ambient noise." Values proximity to outlets and reliable WiFi. Frustrated when internet drops during calls.</p>

            <h4>AI Value</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Pattern recognition across multiple observation sessions</li>
              <li>Clustering of similar behaviors or environments</li>
              <li>Transcription of audio/video field recordings</li>

            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Key Considerations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>AI for Note Organization:</strong> Use AI to tag and cluster field notes by AEIOU category. But humans must validate the tagging—AI can misclassify subtle observations.</li>
          <li><strong>Video Analysis:</strong> AI can transcribe and timestamp video recordings, making it easier to review key moments. But humans must interpret the "why" behind actions.</li>
          <li><strong>Pattern Detection:</strong> AI can surface recurring themes (e.g., "users always check phone before starting task"). Humans must assess if patterns are meaningful or coincidental.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>"AI in the Loop" Model</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Field Note Augmentation:</strong> Humans capture observations in the field. AI transcribes audio notes and categorizes them into AEIOU buckets. Humans review and refine.</li>
          <li><strong>Pattern Highlighting:</strong> AI scans multiple observation sessions to identify recurring Activities, Objects, or Interactions. Humans prioritize which patterns to investigate further.</li>
          <li><strong>Synthesis Support:</strong> AI generates initial themes from AEIOU notes. Humans validate, merge themes, and connect insights to design opportunities.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Watch-Outs</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>AI cannot replace the researcher's physical presence. Contextual insights (tone, body language, environmental cues) are lost in automated analysis.</li>
          <li>Don't rely on AI for ethical decisions. Observational research requires consent and respect for privacy—AI cannot make these judgments.</li>
          <li>Beware of over-categorization. AI may force observations into rigid AEIOU buckets when reality is messier. Always allow for ambiguity and overlap.</li>
