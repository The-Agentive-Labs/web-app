          <h3>What is a Problem Hypothesis?</h3>
          <p>A Problem Hypothesis is an educated guess about a challenge or unmet need your users may face. It acts as a North Star for early discovery research, helping teams focus their efforts before they have validated insights. Think of it as planting a flag in uncharted territory—you believe there's something valuable there, but you need to explore to confirm it.</p>

          <h3>Framework & Placement</h3>
          <p>Problem Hypotheses are formulated at the very start of the product discovery process—even before primary research. They emerge from:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Observed market trends or competitive gaps</li>
            <li>Anecdotal feedback from support tickets or sales calls</li>
            <li>Visionary product ideas or strategic business goals</li>
            <li>Light secondary research (articles, industry reports, internal data)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Once stated, the hypothesis becomes the focus of exploratory research (interviews, surveys, secondary research) to validate or invalidate the assumption.</p>

          <h3>Best Practices</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Be Specific:</strong> Vague problems lead to vague research. "Users struggle with productivity" is too broad. "Freelance designers waste time re-invoicing clients due to unclear payment terms" is actionable.</li>
            <li><strong>Make it Testable:</strong> Frame your hypothesis so you can prove or disprove it through research. Avoid opinions; focus on observable behaviors or outcomes.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay User-Centered:</strong> Ground the hypothesis in a user need, not just a business goal. "We need to increase revenue" is not a problem hypothesis. "SMB owners lack affordable tools to manage inventory" is.</li>
            <li><strong>Embrace Being Wrong:</strong> A disproven hypothesis is still valuable—it saves you from building the wrong thing. Research is about learning, not confirming your biases.</li>
            <li><strong>Limit Scope:</strong> Start with one clear problem. You can expand later, but early focus prevents analysis paralysis.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Template: Problem Hypothesis Statement</h3>
          <div class="code-block">
            <code>We believe that [USER SEGMENT]<br>
experiences [PROBLEM/PAIN POINT]<br>
when [SITUATION/CONTEXT].<br>
<br>
This matters because [IMPACT/CONSEQUENCE].<br>
<br>
We will know we're right if we observe [SUCCESS CRITERIA/EVIDENCE].</code>
          </div>

          <h3>Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Identify the User Segment:</strong> Who are you designing for? Be specific (e.g., "remote workers in tech startups" vs. "office workers").</li>
            <li><strong>Define the Problem:</strong> What pain point or unmet need do you suspect exists? Use clear, observable language.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Context:</strong> When or where does this problem occur? Context helps narrow the scope and makes the problem more tangible.</li>
            <li><strong>Articulate the Impact:</strong> Why does this problem matter? What are the consequences if it goes unsolved?</li>
            <li><strong>Set Success Criteria:</strong> What evidence would validate your hypothesis? This could be user quotes, behavioral data, or measurable outcomes.</li>
            <li><strong>Review & Refine:</strong> Share your hypothesis with stakeholders. Does it align with business goals? Is it specific enough to guide research?</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Example</h3>
          <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong></p>
            <p>We believe that <strong>freelance graphic designers</strong> experience <strong>cash flow anxiety and wasted administrative time</strong> when <strong>tracking payments from multiple clients with inconsistent invoicing schedules</strong>.</p>
            <p>This matters because <strong>missed or delayed payments can threaten their financial stability, and time spent chasing invoices reduces billable hours</strong>.</p>
            <p>We will know we're right if we observe <strong>designers mentioning invoice tracking as a top-3 pain point in interviews, or if we find data showing 40%+ of invoices are paid late</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Key Considerations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>AI as a Research Assistant:</strong> Use AI to scan Reddit threads, reviews, or support logs for recurring themes. But always validate with real user conversations—AI can spot frequency, not emotional weight.</li>
          <li><strong>Bias Risk:</strong> AI models reflect the data they're trained on. If you ask AI to generate a hypothesis, it may default to common assumptions rather than novel insights. Always stress-test AI-generated ideas with human intuition.</li>
          <li><strong>Hypothesis Refinement:</strong> AI excels at rewriting and sharpening language. Use it to make your hypothesis more concise or testable, but ensure the core idea stays human-driven.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>"AI in the Loop" Model</h3>
        <p>Three ways AI can enhance problem hypothesis development:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Exploratory Input:</strong> AI scans secondary sources (articles, forums, competitor reviews) to surface potential problem areas. Humans then curate and prioritize based on strategic fit.</li>
          <li><strong>Iterative Shaping:</strong> Humans draft an initial hypothesis. AI suggests alternative framings, identifies ambiguities, or proposes testable success criteria. The team refines collaboratively.</li>
          <li><strong>Validation Prep:</strong> AI generates interview questions or survey prompts aligned with the hypothesis. Humans review for tone, bias, and cultural appropriateness before deployment.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Watch-Outs</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Don't let AI generate the entire hypothesis from scratch—it lacks strategic context and user empathy.</li>
          <li>Avoid over-reliance on AI-scraped data (reviews, forums) as the sole foundation. This data is noisy and may not represent your actual user base.</li>
          <li>Be cautious of "HiPPO Bias" (Highest Paid Person's Opinion). AI can accidentally amplify existing biases if trained on your internal documents. Seek external perspectives.</li>
        </ul>
