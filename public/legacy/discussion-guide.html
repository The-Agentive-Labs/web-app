          <h3>What is a Discussion Guide?</h3>
          <p>A Discussion Guide is a structured document that outlines the flow, questions, and prompts for user interviews or focus groups. It's not a rigid script—it's a flexible framework that ensures you cover key topics while leaving room for organic conversation. Think of it as your research GPS: it keeps you on track without forcing a specific route.</p>

          <h3>Why Use a Discussion Guide?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Ensures all interviews cover the same topics, making synthesis easier.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Keeps interviews focused and on-time (30-60 mins).</li>
            <li><strong>Confidence:</strong> Reduces facilitator anxiety. You won't forget important questions.</li>
            <li><strong>Team Alignment:</strong> Multiple researchers can conduct interviews using the same structure.</li>
            <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Provides flexibility to probe deeper when interesting insights emerge.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Core Components</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Introduction:</strong> Set expectations, build rapport, explain purpose</li>
            <li><strong>Warm-Up:</strong> Easy, non-threatening questions to ease participants in</li>
            <li><strong>Core Questions:</strong> The heart of the interview—exploring behaviors, problems, motivations</li>
            <li><strong>Probing Questions:</strong> Follow-ups to dig deeper ("Tell me more," "Why is that important?")</li>
            <li><strong>Wrap-Up:</strong> Final reflections, anything missed, next steps</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Best Practices</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Open-Ended Questions:</strong> "How do you..." beats "Do you...?" Stories reveal truth; yes/no answers don't.</li>
            <li><strong>Chronological Flow:</strong> Start broad, narrow down. Past behavior → Current state → Future needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Neutral Language:</strong> Avoid leading questions. "What do you think about X?" not "Don't you love X?"</li>
            <li><strong>Timebox Sections:</strong> Allocate time (e.g., Intro: 5min, Core: 40min, Wrap: 5min). Stay flexible but aware.</li>
            <li><strong>Build in Probes:</strong> Add follow-up prompts for common responses. Prepare for "I don't know" or silence.</li>
            <li><strong>Iterate:</strong> After 3-5 interviews, refine questions based on what's working (or not).</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Define Research Objectives:</strong> What specific questions do you need answered? Write them down.</li>
            <li><strong>Identify Key Topics:</strong> Break objectives into 3-5 themes (e.g., current behaviors, pain points, needs).</li>
            <li><strong>Write Questions:</strong> For each topic, write 2-4 open-ended questions. Focus on past behavior and stories.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Probes:</strong> Under each question, add 2-3 follow-up prompts to dig deeper.</li>
            <li><strong>Time It:</strong> Assign time to each section. Total should be 45-60 mins.</li>
            <li><strong>Pilot the Guide:</strong> Test with 1-2 people. Are questions clear? Do you get useful answers? Adjust as needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Use It Flexibly:</strong> During interviews, follow the guide but allow organic detours. If a participant says something interesting, probe deeper.</li>
          </ol>

          <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Research Goal:</strong> Understand freelancers' invoicing workflows, pain points, and unmet needs.</p>

            <p><strong>Introduction (5 min):</strong> "Thanks for joining. We're learning about how freelancers manage invoices and payments. No right or wrong answers—just your honest experience. Can I record for notes?"</p>

            <p><strong>Warm-Up (5 min):</strong></p>

              <li>"Tell me about your freelance work. What do you do?"</li>
              <li>"How many clients do you work with at a time?"</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Topic 1: Current Process</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>"Walk me through the last time you invoiced a client. What steps did you take?"</li>
              <li>[Probe: What tools did you use? How long did it take?]</li>
              <li>"How do you track whether clients have paid?"</li>
              <li>[Probe: Where do you keep that information? How often do you check?]</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Topic 2: Pain Points</strong></p>
            <ul>

        <h3>Key Considerations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>AI for Question Drafting:</strong> Use AI to generate initial question ideas. But humans must refine for context, tone, and strategic focus.</li>
          <li><strong>Bias Detection:</strong> AI can flag leading questions ("Don't you think...?"). But humans must ensure neutrality throughout.</li>
          <li><strong>Cultural Sensitivity:</strong> AI may miss cultural nuances in question phrasing. Humans must adapt for audience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>"AI in the Loop" Model</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Drafting:</strong> Humans define research objectives. AI suggests question frameworks and phrasing. Humans refine for clarity and context.</li>
          <li><strong>Probing:</strong> AI generates follow-up probe ideas for each question. Humans select the most useful probes and add custom ones.</li>
          <li><strong>Iteration:</strong> After pilot interviews, humans identify weak questions. AI suggests alternatives. Humans test and finalize.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Watch-Outs</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Don't let AI write the entire guide. It lacks strategic context and understanding of your specific research goals.</li>
          <li>Avoid AI-generated generic questions. They work for any topic but lack depth. Tailor questions to your product and users.</li>
          <li>Be cautious of AI-suggested "best practices" that don't fit your context. Not every guide needs the same structure.</li>
          <li>Never use AI to conduct interviews. Discussion guides are for human facilitators only.</li>
        </ul>
