          <h3>What is SET Analysis?</h3>
          <p>SET Analysis is a framework for examining user problems and design solutions across three dimensions: <strong>Social</strong> (how people interact), <strong>Emotional</strong> (how people feel), and <strong>Technical</strong> (how things work). It prevents teams from over-indexing on one dimension while neglecting others—ensuring solutions are technically feasible, emotionally resonant, and socially appropriate.</p>

          <h3>The Three Dimensions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Social:</strong> Group dynamics, cultural norms, collaboration, communication, status, identity, belonging</li>
            <li><strong>Emotional:</strong> Feelings, motivations, anxieties, desires, trust, confidence, satisfaction</li>
            <li><strong>Technical:</strong> Functionality, performance, reliability, usability, integration, scalability</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Why SET Matters</h3>
          <p>Most teams default to technical solutions ("Let's build a feature!") while ignoring social and emotional needs. SET forces balanced thinking:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A technically perfect tool fails if it makes users feel anxious or incompetent</li>
            <li>An emotionally delightful experience fails if it doesn't work reliably</li>
            <li>A socially appropriate solution fails if it ignores how people actually collaborate</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Framework & Placement</h3>
          <p>Use SET Analysis during <strong>Synthesis & Definition</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>After:</strong> Primary research and affinity mapping</li>
            <li><strong>Before:</strong> Solution ideation and feature prioritization</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It helps translate research findings into multi-dimensional problem statements.</p>

          <h3>Best Practices</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Balance All Three:</strong> Don't let one dimension dominate. Technical feasibility matters, but so do emotions and social dynamics.</li>
            <li><strong>Root in Research:</strong> Each SET dimension should be supported by evidence (user quotes, observations, data).</li>
            <li><strong>Use for Problem AND Solution:</strong> Analyze the current problem through SET, then validate your solution addresses all three.</li>
            <li><strong>Collaborate Cross-Functionally:</strong> Engineers see Technical clearly. Designers see Emotional. Researchers see Social. Bring all perspectives.</li>
            <li><strong>Look for Conflicts:</strong> Sometimes dimensions contradict (e.g., technical efficiency vs. emotional reassurance). Identify tradeoffs explicitly.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Define the Problem:</strong> State the user problem or design challenge you're analyzing.</li>
            <li><strong>Analyze Social Factors:</strong> How does this problem affect relationships, collaboration, or group dynamics? What social context matters?</li>
            <li><strong>Analyze Emotional Factors:</strong> What emotions do users experience? What are their motivations and anxieties?</li>
            <li><strong>Analyze Technical Factors:</strong> What functional or system requirements exist? What are the constraints?</li>
            <li><strong>Identify Conflicts:</strong> Where do dimensions contradict? (E.g., efficiency vs. emotional reassurance)</li>
            <li><strong>Validate with Research:</strong> Ensure each dimension is supported by evidence, not assumptions.</li>
            <li><strong>Design Holistically:</strong> Use SET to evaluate solution ideas. Does your solution address all three dimensions?</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Example: Freelance Invoice App</h3>
          <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Freelancers delay following up on overdue invoices, leading to cash flow problems.</p>

            <p><strong>Social Dimension:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Freelancers fear damaging client relationships by appearing "pushy" or "desperate"</li>
              <li>Power dynamic: clients hold financial leverage, making confrontation risky</li>
              <li><em>Evidence:</em> "I don't want to seem like I'm nagging. What if they stop working with me?" (Interview #7)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Emotional Dimension:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Anxiety about cash flow and ability to pay bills</li>
              <li>Embarrassment about asking for money ("feels awkward")</li>
              <li>Desire to appear professional and in control</li>
              <li><em>Evidence:</em> "I lose sleep over unpaid invoices. But I hate being the person who has to ask." (Interview #3)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Technical Dimension:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>No automated system to track invoice status or send reminders</li>
              <li>Manual follow-up requires remembering due dates and composing emails</li>
              <li>No integration between invoicing and payment platforms</li>
              <li><em>Evidence:</em> 85% of survey respondents use manual tracking (spreadsheets, email)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Solution Implications:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Social:</strong> Automate reminders so freelancers don't have to personally "nag." Frame as system-generated, not personal.</li>
              <li><strong>Emotional:</strong> Provide reassurance ("80% of invoices are paid within 7 days"). Reduce anxiety with visibility.</li>
              <li><strong>Technical:</strong> Build auto-reminders, payment tracking, and sync with Stripe/PayPal.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>Pattern recognition across research data (transcripts, surveys)</li>
              <li>Tagging of emotional keywords and sentiment</li>

        </div>

        <h3>Key Considerations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>AI for Data Tagging:</strong> Use AI to scan research data and tag content by SET category (social interactions, emotional language, technical mentions). Humans validate and interpret.</li>
          <li><strong>Emotional Analysis Limits:</strong> AI can flag emotional keywords ("anxious," "frustrated") but cannot understand the depth or cultural context. Humans must interpret.</li>
          <li><strong>Social Nuance:</strong> AI struggles with social dynamics, power structures, and cultural norms. These require human cultural intelligence.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>"AI in the Loop" Model</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Data Categorization:</strong> AI scans research findings (interviews, surveys) and tags content by SET dimension. Humans review and refine categories.</li>
          <li><strong>Pattern Identification:</strong> AI identifies recurring themes within each dimension (e.g., "payment anxiety" in Emotional). Humans assess strategic importance.</li>
          <li><strong>Conflict Mapping:</strong> Humans identify where SET dimensions conflict. AI suggests similar cases or precedents. Humans decide on tradeoffs.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Watch-Outs</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Don't let AI perform the entire SET analysis. It lacks the empathy, cultural awareness, and strategic judgment required.</li>
          <li>Avoid over-reliance on AI sentiment analysis. Emotional and social dimensions require deep human interpretation.</li>
          <li>Be cautious of AI missing power dynamics and social hierarchies. These are often implicit and require contextual understanding.</li>
        </ul>
